The provided text outlines a comprehensive analysis of thermodynamic cycles, primarily focusing on the operation, classification, and performance metrics of Internal Combustion Engines (ICEs). The fundamental purpose of an engine is defined as transforming the chemical energy of a fuel into thermal energy, which is then utilized to perform useful work.

A key distinction is drawn between ICEs and External Combustion Engines (ECEs). ICEs, where combustion occurs inside the cylinder, are characterized by higher efficiency (approximately 35-40%), lighter weight, and compactness compared to ECEs (15-20% efficiency), which are heavier and noisier but can utilize cheaper fuels. ICEs are categorized by their ignition method—Spark Ignition (SI) versus Compression Ignition (CI)—and their stroke cycle (Four-stroke or Two-stroke). The working cycles primarily analyzed are the Otto cycle (constant volume) and the Diesel cycle (constant pressure).

Engine performance is quantified using a suite of parameters, including Indicated Horse Power (I.H.P.) and Brake Horse Power (B.H.P.), with the difference being the Frictional Horse Power (F.H.P.). The document thoroughly defines various efficiencies, such as Mechanical Efficiency ($\eta_m$), Volumetric Efficiency ($\eta_v$), and Brake Thermal Efficiency ($\eta_{bth}$), which are crucial for evaluating the engine's effectiveness in converting fuel energy into output power. Essential terminology like Compression Ratio ($r$) and Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC) are also established as key design and performance indicators.

The analysis concludes by examining advanced fuel supply systems, highlighting the role of electronic control in modern engines. Multi-Point Fuel Injection (MPFI) and Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) represent significant technological progress. MPFI uses an Electronic Control Unit (ECU) and various sensors (e.g., air flow, engine speed, knock sensor) to precisely regulate the Air-Fuel (A/F) ratio for optimum conditions. GDI, which injects fuel directly into the combustion chamber, offers superior advantages, including enhanced vaporization, higher volumetric efficiency, improved mileage, better overall performance across all loads, and lower exhaust emissions. These systems are essential for achieving high efficiency and meeting modern performance and emission standards.
